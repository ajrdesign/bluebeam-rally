                    <p>The lifelong racing career of Anders Nystedt is packed full of excitement and speed. He started in a Saab V4 Standard B before switching to a brand new Opel Ascona A Rally and starting the Hemglass Racing Team for the Swedish Championship in Rallycross. Always focused on the next victory, Anders soon started another team called “Anders Kläder Racing”, which first competed in the Saab but soon switched to four rear wheel Toyota Starlets. Anders competed in the Suzuki Cup next with Stocksund Rally Team, highlighted by a second place finish in Group N of the 1989 Swedish Rally. Later, Anders and his friend Kjelle Friberg started JVC Rally Team, a fully-sponsored professional rally team that raced in the Swedish Championship and abroad. Anders’ most memorable moment with JVC occurred in the 1993 Swedish Rally, when Gigi Hamilton, singer of the hit Swedish pop group Freestyle, rode shotgun as the co-driver. Lucky Anders! </p>

                    <p>Racing is in Björn’s blood. He started at the age of 16, joining his father on a team that drove endurance races in a Saab 99, and later as a co-driver for both his father and his cousin. These races gave Björn a great opportunity to learn how to handle a car in high speed, and to find optional apices through corners. After sensing the rally heat and gaining a need for more speed, Björn struck out on his own path in the forest and competed in a standard Golf rally car before becoming the lead driver for Bluebeam Rally Sweden.</p>

                    <p>Christian’s interest in racing and rallying began at the age of 15, staying out late to watch late-night street races and local rally competitions. He started rallying a few years ago, beginning with classes to obtain the obligatory rally license and eventually his co-driver license (You hear that kids? It’s cool to follow the rules). Christian is excited to take rallying full speed with Bluebeam Rally Sweden, and participate for the first time as the driver in a rally competition. </p>

Working out at the gym is also a big part of my life, and I try to go at least four times a week. I’ve also played a lot of golf. I started golfing when I was 5, and by the time I turned 20 I was on the Swedish National Tour.</dd>

                    <p>Jan may be new to rallying but he’s definitely not new to fast cars; his roots are in the street racing circuit. For about 12 years his main passion was tuning and driving cars, but about five years ago Jan started spending more and more time on the tarmac. After many years of encouragement from his good friend and current Bluebeam Rally Sweden teammate, Björn, Jan finally converted to the woods and narrow gravel roads. Rallying first with Björn in a Volkswagen Golf – Class Rally Economy – and now with Bluebeam Rally Sweden. The race is on! </p>
